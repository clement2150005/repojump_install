# repojump

**repojump** is a command-line tool to easily manage, fetch, and jump into GitHub repositories.  
It lets you bulk-track public or private repos, auto-clone them on demand, and jump right into their folders, saving you time when managing multiple projects.

## ‚ú® Features

- Bulk fetch all repos URLS from any GitHub username.
- Track both public and private repositories (with token).
- Jump into any local repo and auto-clone it if missing.
- Update all tracked repo lists in one command.
- Works with both Bash and zsh.

## üîí Security Notice

- **Public repos** can be accessed without authentication.
- **Private repos** require a **GitHub personal access token (PAT)**.
- Tokens are stored locally in:
  ```
  ~/repojump/configs/<username>.config
  ```
  and are saved with `chmod 600` (user-only readable).

**Reminder:**  
This tool is fully open source. You can inspect the code to see exactly how tokens are handled.  
No tokens are transmitted or shared anywhere except directly to GitHub via secure `curl` requests.
